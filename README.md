### I don't know what to call this so for now, it's "Front End".

What it does is takes a bunch of code linters and profilers and combines them into one. It will lint you JS, CSS and Sass. Once the task is complete, it will upload your data to Graphite/Grafana. Completely inspired by -- and some code stolen from -- sitespeed.io.
